# v0.2 (4 Apr 2026)

## Inference & models
- Conv2d forward/backward via implicit GEMM (im2col fused into matmul)
- MaxPool2d, GlobalAvgPool ops; GroupNormSilu fused op
- KV cache infrastructure for autoregressive decode
- U-Net, ResNet-50, and Whisper example models
- ONNX and NNEF model loaders
- macOS / Metal support improvements

## Training
- Differentiable MultiHeadAttn with GQA and CausalAttention backward
- nn module with Adam optimizer and SGD
- Abs/Log/Recip ops, ScatterAdd, MSE/L1 losses, Embedding backward
- GELU backward, SumRows op for bias/RmsNorm weight gradients
- Weight sharing and checkpointing support
- Metrics callbacks and MemorySummary

## Optimizations
- 4×4 register-tiled matmul: 1.5× faster forward, beats PyTorch inference
- 4×4 register-tiled backward matmuls with fused grad accumulation
- Generalize cooperative matrix for any tile size and precision
- 32×32 small-tile matmul/conv shader variants for low-occupancy layers
- Fuse SGD into step() submission (130ms → 99ms training)
- SwiGLUConcat: merge gate+up into single matmul
- Fused SwiGLU/Silu backward ops
- Fused RmsNorm+MatMul kernel (disabled, needs cost model)
- Parallelize Conv2dGradWeight and GroupNormGradW shaders
- K-aware coop threshold for high-K backward matmuls
- e-graph: encode full graph with SwiGLU fusion, optimize before autodiff
- Pre-compute barrier group pass names at session creation

## Correctness fixes
- Fix O(rows×cols²) complexity in RmsNormGradW shader
- Fix attention backward precision: store scores, add weight tying
- Fix derived_params lost during autodiff
- Fix GroupNorm grad race condition
- Fix RoPE convention and dispatch ordering
- Fix Adam buffer cleanup
- Various Metal execution fixes

## Infrastructure
- Switch codegen to WGSL templating
- CI latency benchmark with regression detection
- Conv2d split padding into h/w dimensions
- Windows compatibility, automated venv setup
- SmolVLA training benchmark

# v0.1 (26 Mar 2026)

## Inference & models
- SmolLM2-135M and SmolVLA action expert inference via blade-graphics (Vulkan)
- Vision ops: RoPE, causal/full/cross attention, RMSNorm, LayerNorm, SwiGLU, GELU, Embedding
- Single-pass causal attention (KV computed and consumed in one dispatch)
- HuggingFace SafeTensors model loading

## Optimizations
- Cooperative-matrix 2×2-tile matmul (16×16×16 WMMA, 32×32 output per workgroup)
- FusedMatMulAdd: merges `MatMul + Add` into one dispatch
- SwiGLU elementwise fusion: `silu(gate) * up` in a single kernel
- e-graph (egglog) optimization pass for pattern-driven fusion and canonicalization
- Parallel attention: 64 threads per workgroup (one lane per head dimension)
- Occupancy gate for coop matmul: falls back to scalar tiled path when parallelism is too low (e.g. SmolVLA chunk=50)

## Correctness fixes
- Coop matmul edge-tile corruption: secondary accumulators (acc_01/acc_10/acc_11) now guarded against writing to valid-but-wrong buffer positions when the tile extends past matrix bounds
- Coop self-test fixed (N=16→32) to avoid false negatives that disabled WMMA on working hardware
- Fixed OOB storage buffer reads in tiled matmul shader
- Fixed split-K shader binding crash

## Infrastructure
- Execution plan cache (RON serialization) to skip recompilation on repeated runs
- Perfetto binary trace support (`MEGANEURA_TRACE=path`) with blade GPU timestamps
- Benchmarks: SmolVLA meganeura vs PyTorch ROCm comparison script
- System precondition checks (AC power, GPU busy%, clock speed) before benchmarking
- DataLoader with MNIST IDX parser and mini-batch iteration
- Trainer struct with epoch/batch SGD loop
